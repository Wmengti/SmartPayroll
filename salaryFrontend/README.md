## Features

- **Next.js Integration** - This boilerplate is built on top of Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered applications. With Next.js, you can easily create dynamic, SEO-friendly pages and leverage powerful features like automatic code splitting and serverless functions to optimize your app's performance.

- **Secure Wallet Authentication** - Authenticate users securely with RainbowKit, a powerful and easy-to-use wallet authentication library for Ethereum-based dApps. With RainbowKit, you can easily integrate wallet authentication into your app, without having to worry about the complexities of managing private keys or user accounts. RainbowKit supports a wide range of wallets, including MetaMask, WalletConnect, and more.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling** - Effortlessly style your decentralized application with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create beautiful, responsive UIs without writing custom CSS, allowing you to focus on building your app's functionality.

- **WAGMI React Hooks for Ethereum** - WAGMI is a set of React Hooks designed to simplify Ethereum development. With WAGMI, you can easily interact with Ethereum smart contracts, manage user accounts, and handle transactions, all within your React components.
